this is for all those cool cats and kittens that are looking to tackle watercooling on the ender 3. 
currently develpoment pipeline has the ender 3 being a supported project
for the a while and the read.md will be updated as project comes closer to being phased out. 
the current supported mounts are for the titan aqua as it is the most budget friendly offering in terms of watercooling. 
I am currently only uploading the dxf file, stl, and shaper file but once I have created the bom list for parts to complete the upgrade I will update the repo
if you have any question hit me up on discord Vecna_head_of_doom#1719 or email me at Deckerdesign@protonmail.ch
I am trying to keep this as open source as I can and my hope is by giving people the tools to start watercooling we can start to open new ideas and designs

that being said developement is expensive and if you want to help out with the next phase of increasing the waterblock support would be greatly appreciated 
but not expected. paypal.me/z3ro88
